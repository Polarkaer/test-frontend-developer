# Coding task

The purpose of this task is to assess the skills of the candidate, and how they fit into what TestaViva are looking for 
in a frontend developer.

## Task
The candidate must build an interface to browse legal documents. For each document it must be possible to read, add, 
edit and delete comments. We have provided a short video (`Video.mov`) displaying the interface in action. You will 
also find the PNG files for the icons used in the layout (icon-add, icon-arrow, icon-comment, icon-logo, icon-trash) in 
this repository.

As the task is time limited, the most important features to implement are:
-	Base implementation of the design (look-n-feel) in HTML/CSS 
-	API implementation for fetching the documents (pane selection in the top)
-	API implementation for creating new comments

The API for fetching documents and for CRUD operations for comments is available at: `http://api.edelmann.co.uk/api`

The design can be viewed in detail at https://www.figma.com/file/kzR1rObQbGmrscCnVRWyZl/Frontend-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1 
(note: you must create a free account to view colors, margins, shadows etc.)

### Tooling requirements
The test must be completed by using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For CSS it must either be written in vanilla CSS, by using a pre-processor such as SASS or by using the CSS framework 
Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com/).
Although it’s not accepted to use any other framework than Tailwind, (ie. Bootstrap or Foundation) it is accepted to use 
any grid of free choice (it´s also fine to use the grid from Bootstrap for instance).

For JavaScript it must either be written in vanilla JavaScript (preferably ES6/ES7) or by using either the React 
framework or the VueJS framework.
 
## Questions?
If you have questions regarding the understanding of the task, feel free to reach out.

If you run in to issues or problems, you can always try to reach out, but at TestaViva we try to follow these 
guidelines when problems arise:

-	Take a break and distance yourself a little from the problem. Take another look at the code and try to see if any 
other solutions could work. (10 minutes)
-	Google it. If it’s impossible to find anyone else with the same problem, you are almost certainly walking down a 
wrong path. (30 minutes)
-	Grab a cup of coffee and re-consider the problem. (5 minutes)
-	Ask a colleague 

When you arrive at the last step in the above guidelines, you are welcome to reach out to your contact at TestaViva.

## Hand in 

Please fork the repository, write your code, and push it back up to this repository as a feature branch, using your own name as branch name ex. feature/JensJensen, and make pull request.

Please note that this test should take 3-4 hours, but we will not check the time used from the pushes.

# Have fun :-)
